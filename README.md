# spaceship-simulator-Game-using-C-
This project involves building a space shooter game using console graphics in C++, which doesnot require a graphical user interface (GUI) framework. This makes it suitable for beginners and for running in constrained environments. The core gameplay includes moving the player, firing bullets, generating enemies, scoring, and handling collisions.
